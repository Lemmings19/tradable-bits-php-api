# tradable-bits-php-api

A [Tradable Bits](http://tradablebits.com/) API written in PHP. The author of this code has no affiliation with Tradable Bits.

**The OAuth functionality has not been tested.**

Tradable Bits offers the ability to consolidate multiple social media feeds into one managable feed (or 'stream'). They offer a [RESTful API](http://tradablebits.com/developers) for their service, this code interfaces with that API.

I threw this together when Instagram cut off access to their API from the public and I started using Tradable Bits as a workaround (you can get to your Instagram feed via TBits).

This API was adapted from the [Instagram-PHP-API](https://github.com/cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API).
